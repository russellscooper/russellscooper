<h5>09/08/2023</h5>
<p>Today I added my bio information and started a new directory called COVID-19 Dash.
   This dash is intended to be a small weekend project. Im setting a due date for 
   version one at 2400 PT on 09/10/2023. 
   Check README.md in the repository for more information.

<p>I set COVID-19 Dash to private until api problem could be solved. 
   Other than that the project was a good example of how to use CSS,
   js, and html. 
   I will pick this project up a little later and try to fix it. 
   In the mean time, next weeks data project will use python instead of js.
